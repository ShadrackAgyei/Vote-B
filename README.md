- 🎨 **Apple Design**: Clean, minimalistic interface inspired by Apple's design language
- 📊 **Real-Time Results**: Transparent vote counting with visual results
- 🛡️ **Chain Validation**: Automatic blockchain integrity verification
- 🚫 **One Vote Per Voter**: Prevents duplicate voting via email verification
- 💾 **Local Persistence**: Elections and voter data stored locally (ready for database upgrade)

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Custom blockchain implementation with Proof of Work
- **Cryptography**: CryptoJS for hashing and wallet generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm (or yarn/pnpm)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShadrackAgyei/Vote-B.git
cd Vote-B
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## How It Works

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)

1. **Create Elections**: Set election title, description, and voting options
2. **Configure Options**: Add multiple voting options with descriptions
3. **Set Dates**: Define start and end dates for each election
4. **Manage Elections**: Edit, delete, or set active elections
5. **View Statistics**: See registered voter counts per election

### Voter Registration & Voting Flow

1. **Email Registration**: Voters enter their school email address
2. **Email Verification**: Verification code sent to email (check console in demo)
3. **Vote Casting**: Registered voters select an option and cast vote
4. **Block Mining**: Vote is recorded as a blockchain transaction
5. **Results**: Real-time results calculated from blockchain

### Blockchain Implementation

- Each vote is recorded as a transaction in a block
- Blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes
- Proof of Work consensus ensures block validity
- The chain validates its own integrity
- Email addresses used as voter identifiers

### Security Features

- **Admin Authentication**: Password-protected admin dashboard
- Email-based voter registration with verification
- Each voter can only vote once per election (checked by email)
- Votes are immutable once recorded on the blockchain
- Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity
- Chain validation prevents tampering
- Voter verification required before voting
- Session-based admin authentication (24-hour sessions)

## Usage

### Admin Access

1. Navigate to `/admin` page
2. Enter admin password (default: `admin123` for development)
3. You'll stay logged in for 24 hours
4. Click "Logout" to end your session

**Important:** Change the default password in production by setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable.

### Creating a New Election

1. Navigate to `/admin` page and log in
2. Click "Create New Election"
3. Fill in:
   - Election Title
   - Description (optional)
   - Voting Options (add at least 2)
   - Start and End Date/Time
4. Click "Create Election"
5. Set the election as "Active" to make it available for voting

### Voter Registration

1. Voters go to the home page (`/`)
2. Enter their school email address
3. Check email (or browser console in demo) for verification code
4. Enter code to complete registration
5. Once verified, they can cast their vote

### Production Email Integration

Currently, verification codes are logged to the console for demo purposes. To enable real email sending:

1. Integrate an email service (SendGrid, Resend, AWS SES, etc.)
2. Update `lib/utils/email.ts` -> `sendVerificationEmail()` function
3. Configure environment variables for email service credentials

### Admin Password Configuration

For production, set a secure admin password:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here`
3. Restart the development server

**Security Note:** For production deployments, consider implementing server-side authentication instead of client-side password checking.

### Adjusting Blockchain Difficulty

Modify the difficulty in `lib/blockchain/Blockchain.ts`:

```typescript
this.difficulty = 2; // Lower = faster mining, higher = more secure
```

## Development

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run type-check
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Design Philosophy

The app follows Apple's design principles:
- **Simplicity**: Clean, uncluttered interface
- **Clarity**: Clear visual hierarchy and typography
- **Depth**: Subtle shadows and transitions
- **Consistency**: Uniform spacing and component styling
